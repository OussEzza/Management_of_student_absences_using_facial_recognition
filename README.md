# Management of Student Absences using Facial Recognition

## Overview
This project is a student attendance management system that utilizes facial recognition for user authentication. It is designed with two distinct interfaces: one for regular users (students) to mark their attendance through facial recognition, and another for the administrator (president) to manage attendance records and handle student applications.

## Features
- **User Interface for Students:**
  - Mark attendance through facial recognition.

- **Administrator Interface:**
  - Select and view attendance records for a specific date.
  - Manage student applications, approve or reject them, and store new student information.
  - View attendance statistics, including the total number of students present and average attendance rate.
  - Filter attendance records based on various criteria such as department, program of study, etc.
  - Search for specific information quickly.
  - Export attendance records to a file (e.g., CSV).
  - Manage user accounts, including adding and removing accounts.
  - Implement security features such as authentication and authorization.

## Technologies Used
- Python for development
- OpenCV and dlib for facial recognition
- Tkinter for the graphical user interface
- MySQL for database management
